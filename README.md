# Robot-Platoon
In this project, we were tasked to program the FHICT bot. The goal of the project is:
   * To apply embedded systems and software design topics such as C/C++ programming, low-level embedded control, timing, interrupts and feedback-control systems
   * To apply communication knowledge  for IoT communication (optional)
   * to analyse, design, implement, and test this project in a structured way

Hardware needed:
  * STM32 NUCLEO embedded board
  * FHICT bot equipped with two Parallax Feedback 360 degrees High speed Servos, a tracking Line follower Sensor and an ultrasonic distance sensor.
  * ESP32 board (optional)
  * In addition you will need a back plate for the FHICT bot and black tape to create a line on the ground which can be followed.
